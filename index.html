                    <h1>What is The Walking Dead?</h1>
                    <p>The Walking Dead is a popular post-apocalyptic horror television series based on the comic book series of the same name created by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard.<br>
                        The TV series was developed by Frank Darabont and first premiered on AMC on October 31, 2010.<br>
                        The show is set in a world that has been overrun by zombies, referred to as "walkers" or "biters."<br>
                        It follows a group of survivors led by sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes (played by Andrew Lincoln) as they navigate the dangers of this new world, including not only the threat of the undead but also conflicts with other survivors, scarcity of resources, and moral dilemmas.<br>
                        Over its run, "The Walking Dead" has become known for its intense and often graphic depictions of violence, as well as its exploration of themes such as survival, morality, leadership, and the human condition.<br>
                        The show has garnered a large and dedicated fanbase and has spawned spin-off series, including "Fear the Walking Dead" and various webisodes.<br>
                        "The Walking Dead" TV series concluded its eleventh and final season, wrapping up the main storyline in 2022.</p>

                    <span>Rick Grimes</span> is the central character in "The Walking Dead," both in the comic book series created by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard, as well as in the television adaptation developed by Frank Darabont. He is portrayed by British actor Andrew Lincoln in the television series.<br><br>
                    In both versions of the story, Rick Grimes is introduced as a sheriff's deputy in a small Georgia town. He wakes up from a coma to find the world overrun by zombies (referred to as "walkers" or "biters") and embarks on a quest to find his family. Throughout the series, Rick evolves from a law enforcement officer struggling to cope with the new reality to a strong and decisive leader who will do whatever it takes to protect his group of survivors and ensure their survival.<br><br>
                    Rick's character development is central to the narrative of "The Walking Dead," as he faces numerous challenges, moral dilemmas, and personal losses. He becomes known for his leadership skills, strong sense of morality, and willingness to make difficult decisions for the greater good of his group.<br><br>

                    <span>Daryl Dixon</span> 
                    is a fictional character in "The Walking Dead" franchise, portrayed by actor Norman Reedus in the television series of the same name. He is an original character created for the TV show and does not appear in the comic book series.<br><br>
                    Daryl Dixon is introduced early in the series as the younger brother of Merle Dixon, another character in the show. Unlike his brother, Daryl is portrayed as more morally ambiguous at first, often serving as a lone wolf with a penchant for survival skills, hunting, and tracking. He is initially depicted as abrasive and mistrustful of others but gradually forms close bonds with the other survivors, particularly with Rick Grimes, the series' main protagonist.<br><br>
                    Throughout the series, Daryl evolves into a fan-favorite character known for his loyalty, resourcefulness, and protective instincts towards his fellow survivors, especially the core group led by Rick Grimes. He becomes one of the group's most skilled fighters and is often relied upon for his expertise in handling weapons and navigating dangerous situations.

                    <span>Negan Smith</span> 
                    is a prominent character in "The Walking Dead" franchise, known for being the primary antagonist in both the comic book series created by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard, as well as in the television adaptation developed by Frank Darabont. In the TV series, Negan is portrayed by actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan.<br><br>
                    Negan is introduced in the TV series during the sixth season finale and becomes a central figure in the subsequent seasons. He is the ruthless and charismatic leader of a group called the Saviors, who are known for their brutal methods of maintaining control over other survivor communities in the post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies.<br><br>
                    One of Negan's defining characteristics is his use of a weapon known as "Lucille," a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, which he wields with deadly precision. He imposes a strict set of rules on the communities under his control, demanding tribute in exchange for protection while punishing any defiance with extreme violence.
